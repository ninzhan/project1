        <p>Hello and welcome to what is to be my site. I'm still working on it, but this is what I have right now.
            That and I need to talk about my self. School is making me egotistical. I make HTML and Java stoof, and
            am able to work well with Blender. I play League of Legends, Minecraft,
            <a href = "https://guardiansofatlas.com/">Guardians of Atlas</a> which
            which is a funny little indie moba / RTS, Starcraft, Magic: the Gathering, Secret Hitler, and a whole slew
            of other video and board games. I also design board games. One of the games I am making right now is called
            Chit and it is a combo of BS and Poker. I used to like Windows, and I do like Mac.</p>
